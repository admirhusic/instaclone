#Instaclone

## This is an instagram clone

Instagram web made in Laravel and Vue.js

Not all Instagram functionalities are implemented, but the main ones are implemented, if someone is in the mood, feel free to make a pull request. I was bored in quarantine so I played around a bit.

### Instalation

```
git clone

cd instaclone

composer install

npm install

Rename .env.example to .env and edit your database credentials

create a database

php artisan migrate

php artisan key:generate

npm run watch

php artisan serve

```
